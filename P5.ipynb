    "example1 = \"Allen is here in Bangalore, India. One of the major uses cases of named entity recognition involves automating the recommendation process. Recommendation systems dominate how we discover new content and ideas in today’s world. The example of Netflix shows that developing an effective recommendation system can work wonders for the fortunes of a media company by making their platforms more engaging and event addictive. For news publishers, using Named Entity Recognition to recommend similar articles is a proven approach. The below example from BBC news shows how recommendations for similar articles are implemented in real life. This can be done by extracting entities from a particular article and recommending the other articles which have the most similar entities mentioned in them. This is an approach that we have effectively used to develop content recommendations for a media industry client.\""

    "c = \"The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the major pathway for the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Its inhibition causes accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins; this accumulation has been associated with several of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Several genetic factors have been identified for most neurodegenerative diseases, however, most cases are considered idiopathic, thus making the study of the mechanisms of protein accumulation a relevant field of research. It is often mentioned that the biggest risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases is aging, and several groups have reported an age-related alteration of the expression of some of the 26S proteasome subunits and a reduction of its activity. Proteasome subunits interact with proteins that are known to accumulate in neurodegenerative diseases such as α-synuclein in Parkinson's, tau in Alzheimer's, and huntingtin in Huntington's diseases\""
